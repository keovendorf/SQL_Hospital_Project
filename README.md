# SQL Hospital Project
## MIMIC-III (openly accessible critical care patient data set) Database: 
Developed an application that analyzed over 40K critical care patient records spanning millions of rows, extracted that data to a Cloud database, determined predictive variables, and modeled mortality rates based on those parameters. Used a multivariate logistic regression model to identify propensity scores for subjects diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and rapid ventricular response (RVR). The software enabled caregivers to provide more accurate and efficient treatment options. 
      Technologies used:  Google Cloud BigQuery, Python, RStudio, MySQL, and Cloud Data Storage
